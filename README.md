# GPT Behavioral Analysis

This repository, named `gpt_behavioral_analysis`, contains Python scripts designed to evaluate how ChatGPT models behave when simulating a representative role in the IT industry and how they behave as a student. In other words, these scripts assess the extent to which these AI-generated employees and students, known as AI Agents, mimic human behavior. The scripts interact with ChatGPT, posing various scenarios to evaluate the model's responses and effectiveness in this context.

These scripts are executed for the following models:

- GPT-3.5
- GPT-4-turbo
- GPT-4o
- GPT-o4-mini
- GPT-4.1-nano
- Gemma2  
  All results are organized by the model used in the analysis and the focus group and then saved in different folders and files. The data is presented in CSV files, categorized by the models used, and stored in the `results_data` folder.

Additionally, these data files are used by the graphics script and can be accessed in the `graphics` folder.
